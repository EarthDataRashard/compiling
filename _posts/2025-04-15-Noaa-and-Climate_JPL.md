Weather & climate office hour 04/14/2025: Dismantling of NOAA, NASA, & climate research accelerates

The latest in a recurring series of live, virtual, & interactive "office hours" hosted by Dr. Daniel Swain on various topics related to extreme weather and climate. 04/14/2025 topic: Breaking news in recent days surrounding even deeper and more startling cuts to NOAA, NASA, FEMA, and other federal entities responsible for predicting, responding to, or studying weather, climate, wildfires, and disasters in the United States have been raising growing alarm. I'll discuss the latest in today's session, with a focus on potential short and long-term consequences of this proposed and/or unfolding large-scale dismantling of American science.
